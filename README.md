## md5inrust
This is a simple implementation of the md5 message digest algorithm
(RFC 1321) in the Rust programming language. I wrote it while learning
Rust.

To try it out, first clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oscar-franzen/md5inrust
```

Enter the directory and compile the code
```bash
cd md5inrust

# uses Rust's cargo to compile the source file
cargo -r --release
```

## How does the speed compare with `md5sum`?
